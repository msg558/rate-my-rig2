# Rate-My-Rig
A simple demonstration app that I have used to incorporate skills that I have obtained while learning React with Typescript. 

The user can select like or dislike on a photo of a rig and the result will be stored and the leaderboard automatically updated, and then a new photo will be displayed. Additionally, the user can click on an icon in the leaderboard to swap the main display to that photo.
